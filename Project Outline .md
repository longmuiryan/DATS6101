## Outline/Prompts 

### Rubric Goals 

1. Rmarkdown is clearly written and commented. EDA is thoroughly completed with clear purpose and extra effort is seen to fully understand the data prior to moving into more complex analysis.
2. Presentation of data, questions, and answers illustrate insight into thoughtful research process. Presentation provides a clear relatable story through the data. Slides enhance understanding of discussion topic. Students demonstrate a high level understanding of EDA and research processes.
3. Highly relevant research is presented in collaberation with clear indications of how this influenced question development along with detailed reflections on how the outcomes of EDA effected the eventual development of the team's proposed question

### Project Goals - SMART Question

1. Development of a **research driven question (SMART)** focused on a dataset either inside of R or one of your choosing from any online sources.
